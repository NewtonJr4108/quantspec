## This is a project I'm working on; right now it's just a stock viewer. 
Currently using matplotlib-finance to graph stock prices. 

# TODO:
- Add functionality to grab news stories on specific stock being viewed
- Use NLP to search through said news stories and upgrade or downgrade a stock in a rating system, possibly using a model to predict price or general direction
- Come up with a better name
- Improve the GUI


#To start project:
- Initialize virtual environment
```
function test() {
  console.log("source venv/bin/activate");
}
